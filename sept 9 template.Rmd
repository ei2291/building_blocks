I'm an R Markdown document! 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

This is where I'm going to talk about code chunks.
 
```{r include=FALSE}
mean(samp)
sd(samp)
```

Let's also make a dataframe.

```{r}

example_df=
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = 1:4,
    vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "eman"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
  )
```

I'll create a new dataframe. 

```{r}
new_df=
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(100),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

Let's make a plot and see how cool that is!

```{r}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x=rnorm(1000, mean=1, sd=.5),
    y=1+2*x+rnorm(1000)
  )
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x, y=y))+geom_point()
```

This is a neat scatterplot!!!
